## D7
Do something every single day

## Preparation
All you have to do is npm install
- > npm install


## How to start
# When you start for the first time
- At the very first, You have to transpile ES6 written Javascript files. Run gulp and you will get bundled file of client-side-files in client/, and babel-transpiled file of server-side-files in build/. Then, nodemon automatically starts build/server.js.
  - > npm run gulp

# If you have run 'gulp' before
- If you have changes in client-side-files, do as below and it will bundle all Javascript files in client/. Then attach watcher on clinet/ and this will automatically re-bundle the files when there is any change in client-side-files.
  - > npm run webpack-watch

- If you have changes in server-side-files, run gulp again and this will work as same as above.
  - > npm run gulp

# If you want to use react-hot-loader
- You can use react-hot-loader on client-side-files in client/.
  - > npm run webpack-hot

# If you just want to run server and you already transpiled client && server-side files
- start with transpiled 'build/server.js' using node
  - > npm start
